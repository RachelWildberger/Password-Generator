# Password-Generator

## Description

Created an application that the user can generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app runs in the browser, and features HTML, CSS, and is powered by JavaScript code.

For a user that wants a strong password that provides greater security, we created a password that meets specific criteria; using numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.
